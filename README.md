# Distributed-Database-Analysis-Project

This report outlines my project which is focused on analysing road safety data from 2018 using the 'RoadSafetyData_Casualties_2018.csv' dataset. The primary objective was to utilise the Hadoop Framework, specifically Java MapReduce, to analyse the dataset and count the total number of accidents indexed by each severity band. The report begins by emphasising the global importance of road safety, citing statistics from the Global Status Report on Road Safety by Margaret Chan.

The report provides an overview of the Hadoop ecosystem, including components like HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce, highlighting their roles in distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It explains the installation and configuration process for Ubuntu, Java, and Hadoop across multiple virtual machines, followed by a detailed explanation of each Hadoop configuration file's role and setup.

The project also includes the installation of Eclipse for Java development and the writing of MapReduce Java scripts for data processing. The process of running MapReduce jobs on the dataset is explained, including transferring data to HDFS and verifying job execution.

Additionally, the report covers the installation of Apache Spark, though it was not utilised for this project, providing insights into its setup and configuration.

Finally, the report offers a critique and discussion section, reflecting on the project's successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. It acknowledges the effectiveness of MapReduce and Hadoop for data processing tasks but highlights the complexity and potential for errors in the setup process. Suggestions for improvement include exploring more modern tools like Apache Spark and streamlining the setup process for greater efficiency and reliability.

In summary, the project achieved its analytical goals while providing valuable insights into distributed data processing techniques. It identifies areas for improvement and suggests future directions for enhancing the project's outcomes and applicability in real-world scenarios.
